# EXPERIMENTAL: React style Hook & Custom Hooks in Seed 

These have now moved to published crates :

*  [comp_state](https://github.com/rebo/comp_state)
*  [seed_comp_helpers](https://github.com/rebo/seed_comp_helpers)
*  [simple_seed_comp_state_example](https://github.com/rebo/simple_seed_comp_state_example)

Everything in here is old and the above should be used instead.
